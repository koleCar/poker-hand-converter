/**
 * Every user-facing string of the desktop app, in English - the source
 * locale. `hr.ts` has the same shape, checked against `Dict` (`types.ts`), so
 * a key cannot exist in one language and not the other.
 *
 * The same pattern as the web's `frontend/src/lib/i18n/en.ts`, much smaller:
 * nested plain objects, `as const`; a string that takes an argument is a
 * function, so the argument is type-checked and a translator sees the whole
 * sentence. Components get the dictionary from `useT()` (`index.tsx`); the
 * lint rule in `eslint.config.js` rejects bare JSX text and bare
 * `title` / `aria-label` / `placeholder` / `alt` literals in `src/**`.
 *
 * The tray menu is drawn by the Rust side, which has its own copy of the
 * `tray` strings (`src-tauri/src/strings.rs`); keep the two in step.
